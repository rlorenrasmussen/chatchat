# chatchat
an app for making your friends get their shit done (and for them to make you get your shit done too)

# what is this for?
This is a light and fun app for friends to get better and get their own shit done together. This does not assume the inherent bad faith of non-consensual cooperation. I.e., don't use this for your school/work group projects, you fucking monster. This isn't a kanban app, even if it smells like one.

See [the Design Document](DESIGN.md) for more info about the features of the app.

## installing
uhhh fuck, uh shit
